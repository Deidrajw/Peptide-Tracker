# Nexus — Regression Matrix

> Reusable acceptance criteria, NOT proof of execution. Each release must supply an interactive in-chat Pass/Fail/Not Tested checklist with Copy Results. Date and link evidence for every actual test; never assume a Pass.

| Area | Critical test | Status for proposed v0.9.1-beta |
|---|---|---|
| Today | Completed/pending status from saved record; direct Edit opens correct date | NOT TESTED |
| Daily Check-In | Validate date; one record/day; editing persists mood, notes and symptom intensities | NOT TESTED |
| Symptoms | Search and browse; 1–3 intensity; general, custom and compound associations | NOT TESTED |
| Supplements | Check-In and Log Supplements search, scroll, browse, multi-select, Selected Today; date-specific historic safety | NOT TESTED |
| Calendar | Fresh current Month default; navigation; numeric weights; date detail | NOT TESTED |
| Log Dose | Source choice, draft recovery, Confirm, scrollable content, safe-area sticky footer | NOT TESTED |
| Stash / inventory | Single/multi-vial allocation, exact subtraction, insufficient-stock and no duplicate deduction | NOT TESTED |
| Protocol | Compound cards, plans, linked schedules and disclosures preserve state | NOT TESTED |
| Weight / Nutrition | Entry/edit persistence and numerical history | NOT TESTED |
| More / Settings / Backups | Settings persistence; import/export and backups protected | NOT TESTED |
| Shared disclosure UI | Chevron alignment, consistent outline/stroke, expanded direction, 44–48px targets and focus/keyboard access | NOT TESTED |
| Responsiveness | 320px and 390px widths; light/dark; no clipping, nesting, white gutters or double scrolling | NOT TESTED |
| Full-app DEMO | Entire app, every page/modal, matching DOM IDs, no null.innerHTML; fictional fixtures and isolated storage | NOT TESTED |
| LIVE/DEMO parity | Both generated from exact release source; complete ZIP includes root index.html and assets | NOT TESTED |

## Evidence log (append actual runs)
- Version, date and tester:
- Browser/device, viewport and theme:
- Test case: Pass / Fail / Not Tested
- Expected and observed:
- Screenshots, CI URL or source commit:
- Reproduction and linked defect for failures:
- Explicit limitations and skipped tests:

Physical iPhone tests must be attributed to a real device test, not inferred from automated browser results. Documentation-only changes do not count as app functional testing.

## v0.9.1-beta validation execution entry (2026-10-23)
- Github branch: `release/nexus-v091-validation-artifacts` created from merged application commit e58e675.
- Source checks, browser render 320px/390px both themes, Check-In DOM and DEMO storage isolation: AUTOMATED WORKFLOW ADDED; results NOT TESTED until run evidence is reviewed.
- Physical iPhone: NOT TESTED. Do not mark individual end-to-end dosing, inventory math, history persistence or keyboard scroll as passed from a smoke test.

## Symptom combobox regression (2026-10-23)
- User screenshot: `Constipation` returned no matching results and Browse All contained no choices in Daily Check-In.
- Actual root cause: options JSON stored inside template.content, reader previously used template.textContent.
- PR #19 adds automated DOM checks: open combobox with no query, assert choices; type Constipation, assert visible match; select and assert Selected symptoms. Status: NOT TESTED pending CI results; physical iPhone: FAIL on original LIVE screenshots, retest repaired version pending.

## v0.9.1-beta PR #19 completed automated evidence (2026-10-23)
- Mobile regression on PR branch: PASS (GitHub Actions run 39988223703).
- Source package, demo isolation check, required DOM, responsive browser checks 320/390 and both themes: PASS (run 39988223654).
- Constipation search/browse/selected UI automation included in passing browser matrix.
- Real iPhone originally failed (reported screenshot); fix on main not yet retested on physical device. Status: NOT TESTED after fix.
- Full persistence/inventory functional suite: NOT TESTED; automation is a smoke/DOM matrix and cannot replace full end-to-end verification.
- Post-merge GitHub Pages success: NOT VERIFIED.

## v0.9.2-beta pre-merge matrix
- Grouped headings present: NOT TESTED.
- Constipation search across group: NOT TESTED.
- Group collapse/expand and selection persistence: NOT TESTED.
- Real iPhone at 320/390 dark/light: NOT TESTED.
- Full-app DEMO and LIVE ZIP: NOT TESTED until CI builds.

## v0.9.2 symptom category user acceptance (2026-10-23)
- Added automated checks for presence of Digestive, Energy & Sleep, PMS & Cycle, active Retatrutide-specific category in fictional DEMO, category expand/collapse, Constipation search, selection and intensity buttons.
- Execute at 320px/390px, light and dark, standalone full-app DEMO and LIVE served source. Latest run evidence: PENDING; real iPhone: NOT TESTED; persistence/compound association deep tests: NOT TESTED.

- Default collapsed state and first expand/collapse transition are directly asserted in automated browser QA. Search results are still expected even when categories begin collapsed. Current latest run: PENDING.

## v0.9.2-beta merged PR #21 evidence — 2026-10-23
- **PASS, automated:** 8 LIVE/DEMO cases at 320px and 390px, dark/light; grouped Digestive, Energy & Sleep, PMS & Cycle headings; active Retatrutide-specific fictional category; category collapse and re-expand; Constipation search; selected symptom and three intensity options; Check-In modal DOM and overflow check; main tab navigation smoke; isolated demo storage; safe demo banner. Evidence: https://github.com/Deidrajw/Peptide-Tracker/actions/runs/40030583792.
- **PASS, automated:** existing mobile form regression: https://github.com/Deidrajw/Peptide-Tracker/actions/runs/40030583750.
- **NOT TESTED:** real iPhone after release; complete saved Check-In editing persistence, compound tagging history, Log Dose single/multi-vial deductions and insufficient-stock, Calendar numerical weight historical correctness, entire application end-to-end, Pages deployment after merge. CI smoke tests must not imply these flows passed.
- **KNOWN OPEN:** light-theme Save Check-In on bright yellow visually low contrast in captured automation screenshot; address in next contrast audit.
